# Internship Questions

##### 1. How did you decide what to show on the main page vs details?

When I decide what to show on the main page versus the details page, I think about what the user needs right away and what can wait until they’re interested enough to click deeper.

- On the main page, I keep it simple: just the highlights or a quick overview. Something that can be understood at a glance without scrolling too much. Basically, the things almost everyone would care about.

- On the details page, I put all the extra information — the stuff that’s still important but not something you need to see immediately. This is where you can go deeper, explore, compare, or interact more.

##### 2. What design choices did you make to keep it clean?

   To keep the design clean, I focused on a few things:

- Give things room to breathe – I didn’t cram everything together. Spacing between sections makes it easy to scan.

- Stick to a simple color palette – just a few main colors for backgrounds, text, and highlights. Too many colors get messy.

- Keep fonts consistent – only a couple of sizes for headings and body text so everything feels organized.

- Use icons where possible – small visuals make information quicker to understand than long text.

- Prioritize what’s important – the key info goes upfront, and secondary details are tucked away if needed.

- Use separate sections/cards – each feature has its own card or tile so the layout feels structured and neat.

  Basically, I tried to make it easy for users to find what they need without feeling overwhelmed.

##### 3. If the system had 10,000 credits, how would you keep the dashboard fast?

   If the system had 10,000 credits, I’d keep the dashboard fast by not trying to load everything at once.

- I’d show only a small chunk at a time using pagination or infinite scroll, so the page loads instantly.

- For long lists, I’d use virtual scrolling, which only renders what’s visible on screen. This keeps the page light and smooth.

- I’d cache data so users don’t have to fetch the same information repeatedly.

  Basically, it’s all about loading smartly and showing what the user needs without overwhelming the browser.
